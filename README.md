# 🚀 Lunar Lander - Reinforcement Learning Project

This project demonstrates how to train an agent using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** in OpenAI Gym's **LunarLander-v2** environment. The agent learns to control a lunar module and land it safely on a designated landing pad by interacting with the environment and optimizing its actions through rewards.
